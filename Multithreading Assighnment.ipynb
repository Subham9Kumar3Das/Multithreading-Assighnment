    "  * Multithreading makes programs run faster.\n",
    "  * It allows multiple tasks to share memory, reducing memory usage compared to separate tasks.\n",
    "  * It's great for tasks like reading/writing files or dealing with the internet, as other tasks can continue while waiting for I/O operations to finish.\n",

    "* Disadvantages\n",
    "  * It can be more complex to write and manage multithreaded programs due to synchronization and potential issues like deadlocks.\n",
    "  * Finding and fixing bugs in multithreaded programs can be difficult and challenging.\n",
    "  * Sometimes, the overhead of managing threads can outweigh the benefits of concurrency.\n",
    "  * As the number of threads increases, managing them and ensuring they work efficiently becomes more challenging."
